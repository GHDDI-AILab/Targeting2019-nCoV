<h1 id="targeting-covid-19-ghddi-info-sharing-portal">Targeting COVID-19: GHDDI Info Sharing Portal</h1>
<p>This is the public information sharing portal and data repository for the drug discovery community, initiated by <a href="http://www.ghddi.org">GHDDI</a>. We are making our drug discovery capabilities and resources available at no cost to all researchers who are developing new treatments for COVID-19. We hope this initiative will accelerate the process of drug discovery for this deadly viral disease. The initial effort includes the following :</p>
<p>1) GHDDI will make its high throughput screening platform and multiple compound libraries available to all researchers for target-based or phenotypic-based screens. These compound libraries include the <a href="https://reframedb.org/">ReFRAME</a> compound library (the world’s largest collection of its kind, containing over 12,000 known drugs, most of which have gone through Phase I clinical studies), a diversity-based synthetic compound library, a natural product library, a traditional Chinese medicine extract library, etc. We welcome research groups with high quality 2019-nCoV related enzymatic assays or phenotypic assays to discuss long term collaboration plans for ReFrame library screening. </p>
<p>2) GHDDI will make its COVID-19 Drug Discovery Cloud Computing System available to researchers including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GHDDI COVID-19 Data Repositories: antiviral pharmacology database, 3D structure data for SARS-CoV-2 targets and related host targets and virtual compound libraries covering millions of commercially available compounds; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GHDDI COVID-19 Computational Systems: trained AI drug screening models and fully configured Pytorch based deep learning environment, conventional virtual screening system using tools like GOLD, AutoDock with parallelized processing capability and biophysics computational tools like Amber, NAMD for target mechanism study and free energy computation for docking refinement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3) GHDDI will collaborate with CROs (with deep gratitude to the commitment and contribution made by BioDuro) to offer services including  small-molecule chemical synthesis, drug design, medicinal chemistry, DMPK, target protein generation/biophysics/structural biology, etc.</p>
<p>4) GHDDI will provide consultation on disease biology, pharmaceutical sciences and drug discovery.</p>
<p>We are confident that, with concerted efforts by worldwide research community, we will conquer this novel coronavirus!</p>

<h3 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h3>
<p>We're from GHDDI (The Global Health Drug Discovery Institute). GHDDI was jointly founded by Tsinghua University, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Beijing Municipal Government. The Institute is a transformative drug discovery and translational platform with advanced biomedical research and development capabilities. It is an independent, not-for-profit institute with a broad interest in addressing global health concerns, regardless of financial incentives, and intends to focus its efforts on tackling the world’s most pressing disease challenges faced by many developing countries. GHDDI has established several first-class research platforms in the areas of medicinal chemistry, lead generation/high-throughput screening, CADD and AI-based drug discovery, structural biology, DMPK and animal facility. We hope to share our expertise and resources and collaborate with partners who have relevant disease biology or complementary drug discovery and development expertise with an interest toward finding new treatment for the novel coronavirus. In addition, GHDDI has extensive partnerships with over 20 research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and disease alliances in China and worldwide. </p>
