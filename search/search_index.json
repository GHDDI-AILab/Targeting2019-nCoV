We are making our drug discovery capabilities and resources available at no cost to all researchers who are developing new treatments for COVID-19. We hope this initiative will accelerate the process of drug discovery for this deadly viral disease. The initial effort includes the following : 1) GHDDI will make its high throughput screening platform and multiple compound libraries available to all researchers for target-based or phenotypic-based screens. These compound libraries include the ReFRAME compound library (the world\u2019s largest collection of its kind, containing over 12,000 known drugs, most of which have gone through Phase I clinical studies), a diversity-based synthetic compound library, a natural product library, a traditional Chinese medicine extract library, etc. We welcome research groups with high quality 2019-nCoV related enzymatic assays or phenotypic assays to discuss long term collaboration plans for ReFrame library screening. 2) GHDDI will make its COVID-19 Drug Discovery Cloud Computing System available to researchers including: GHDDI COVID-19 Data Repositories: antiviral pharmacology database, 3D structure data for SARS-CoV-2 targets and related host targets and virtual compound libraries covering millions of commercially available compounds; GHDDI COVID-19 Computational Systems: trained AI drug screening models and fully configured Pytorch based deep learning environment, conventional virtual screening system using tools like GOLD, AutoDock with parallelized processing capability and biophysics computational tools like Amber, NAMD for target mechanism study and free energy computation for docking refinement. 3) GHDDI will collaborate with CROs (with deep gratitude to the commitment and contribution made by BioDuro) to offer services including small-molecule chemical synthesis, drug design, medicinal chemistry, DMPK, target protein generation/biophysics/structural biology, etc. 4) GHDDI will provide consultation on disease biology, pharmaceutical sciences and drug discovery. We are confident that, with concerted efforts by worldwide research community, we will conquer this novel coronavirus!

This effort is to facilitate community wide experimental effort. Please be noted that for any data-driven approach, the interpretation scope of prediction has to be aligned with the original scientific scope of the training set. In addition, for various type of predictive models, noises and biases inherited from training set or empirical parameters, limitations of different mathematical approximations have to be considered. Therefore, these computational results have to be further analyzed by experienced medicinal chemists and biologists and eventually to be backed up by related wet-lab experiments before any rigorous scientific conclusion. The web-based service based on these predictive models will be open to public soon to facilitate your own screening efforts using your own compound libraries. The models and results are constantly updated upon the collection of new evidence. Drug Repurposing Effort A. Ligand based AI models We have tried different training sets containing different virus species and their targets to build target specific or phenotype based classification AI models using GHDDI self-developed HAG-net deep learning system. We only selected models showing 5-fold cross-validation AUC>0.8 as qualification for further predictive practice and the results are ensemble predictions. Viral targets, including RDRP, Helicase, 3C-like protease of 2019nCoV showing relatively higher cross-species conservation are prioritized in this effort. We use these models to predict different bioactivities of approved or investigational stage drug molecules (~12K) in GHDDI stock as part of the drug repurposing effort. As we are constantly improving our algorithm and expand our training data, the results will be updated periodically. 1. Heterogeneous antiviral AI model Training Data: Using heterogeneous records of antiviral bioactivity data including target based and phenotype based records from various species and in vitro assays, a total of 76247 compounds with 37332 active and 38915 inactive molecules (EC50 <=100nM for at least one viral species as active). Performance (5-fold cross-validation): AUC avg. = 0.94 Active Known Drugs in Training data SMILES Download Top Predicted Active Compounds SMILES Download Predicted Active clusters SMILES Download 2. Phenotypic antiviral AI model Training Data: Using heterogeneous records of antiviral bioactivity data of phenotype based records from various species and in vitro assays, a total of 7305 compounds with 3751 active and 3554 inactive molecules (EC50 <=100nM for at least one viral species as active). Performance (5-fold cross-validation): AUC avg. = 0.90 Active Known Drugs in Training data SMILES Download Top Predicted Active Compounds SMILES Download Predicted Active Clusters SMILES Download 3. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase AI model Training Data: Using heterogeneous records of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase related bioactivity data from various species and in vitro assays, a total of 583 compounds with 60 active and 517 inactive molecules (IC50 <=100nM as active). Performance (5-fold cross-validation): AUC avg. = 0.898 Active Known Drugs in Training data SMILES Download Top Predicted Active Compounds SMILES Download Predicted Active Clusters SMILES Download 4. Helicase AI model Training Data: Using heterogeneous records of Helicase related bioactivity data from various species and in vitro assays, a total of 788 compounds with 42 active and 746 inactive molecules (IC50 <=100nM as active). Performance (5-fold cross-validation): AUC avg. = 0.868 Active Known Drugs in Training data SMILES Download Top Predicted Active Compounds SMILES Download Predicted Active Clusters: Due to a small number of active compounds, there were no significant clusters identified. 5. 3C-like protease AI model Training Data: Using heterogeneous records of 3C-like protease related bioactivity data from various species and in vitro assays, a total of 457 compounds with 58 active and 399 inactive molecules (IC50 <=100nM as active). Performance (5-fold cross-validation): AUC avg. = 0.832 Active Known Drugs in Training data SMILES Download Top Predicted Active Compounds SMILES Download Predicted Active Clusters SMILES Download B. Structure based (none-docking) AI model The structure based AI model was constructed based on GHDDI developed HAG-net. The model was trained based on all existing drug targets 3D information and their related biochemical data for up to 2 million molecules. The model is universal for all targets with 3D structures. The model performance is evaluated using DUD.E set with average AUC of 0.98 and true negative internal benchmark set with average AUC of 0.8.

This effort is to facilitate community wide experimental effort. Please be noted that for any data-driven approach, the interpretation scope of prediction has to be aligned with the original scientific scope of the training set. In addition, for various type of predictive models, noises and biases inherited from training set or empirical parameters, limitations of different mathematical approximations have to be considered. Therefore, these computational results have to be further analyzed by experienced medicinal chemists and biologists and eventually to be backed up by related wet-lab experiments before any rigorous scientific conclusion. The web-based service based on these predictive models will be open to public soon to facilitate your own screening efforts using your own compound libraries.

We further minimized and simulated some of the models to obtain better structural quality. If you would like to perform any docking practice, please be aware that some of the proteins functioning by forming complex structures with other co-factor proteins of the virus, or with the assistant of other human biomolecules. In addition, proteins are highly dynamic in physiological condition with large conformational flexibility. These structures are only \u201csnapshots\u201d of the real biological event. We will update the structrue list daily to provide more starting points for the research community. If you have structures to upload, please contact us here . We are working on a more interactive interface for your direct participation in the future. The SWISS-MODEL team has also performed comprehensive homology modeling efforts and contacted us to merge their effort here to this project. They modelled the full 2019-nCoV proteome based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 which is identical to GenBank entry MN908947, and annotations from UniProt.

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains. 2020, Mar 14 SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells via a novel route: CD147-spike protein The discovery of the new route CD147-SP for SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs. This study publishes a research finding that SARS-CoV-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147-spike protein (SP), mediating the viral invasion with several in vitro assays validating this result. 2020, Mar 12 A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19 A data-driven framework that combines both machine learning and statistical analysis methods was used to integrate abailable coronavirus data and identify drug candidates against the novel coronavirus. Through this screening, one inhibitor, CVL208, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 with in vitro assays also showing effective inhibitory activity against the novel coronavirus. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion A SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay was used, and it was found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. A series of lipopeptides was generated and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection. 2020, Mar 10 Structure of Mpro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors This study combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening, and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Six compounds were identified which inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03bcM; one of which, ebselen, also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. 2020, Mar 8 AI-aided design of novel targeted covalent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 A novel deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) was developed for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro using a recently published structure (PDB IDL: 6LU7). 47 lead compounds were published from this AI model and are intended to be used for further drug development research.

After mapping using a two-dimensional numerical representation, the magnitude spectra was computed using a Discrete Fourier Transform. Afterwards, a distance matrix was calculated using Pearson Correlation Coefficients and were used as features for different machine learning algorithms. Through 10-fold cross validation, the classification accuracy for coronavirus was over 90%, indicating that 2019-nCoV can be classified closest to sarbecovirus within betacoronavirus. \"Baricitinib as potential treatment for 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease\" Using BenevolentAI knowledge graph to search for approved drugs that could help 2019-nCoV, baricitinib is predicted to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells. This study focuses on the disruption of AAK1 which might interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles. One of the six high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs was baricitinib, and this may have potential to reduce both the viral entry and the inflammation in patients. Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs A family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC) is reported in this study. A SARS-CoV protease inhibitor dataset from ChEMBL, and a binding affinity training set comtaining PDBbind data were used for this model. The model prediccts 8000 potential drugs evaluated based on a latent space binding predictor and a 2D fingerprint predictor. Drug candidates are further evaluated by deep learning models, and logP, logS, and SA score were computed.

The built model suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially SARS and MERS. Additionally, by comparing predicted infectivity patterns, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. It was also suggested that mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov showing that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov. Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model We used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. 2020, Jan 31 Drug treatment options for the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments \"Therapeutic strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China\" Potential treatment options for 2019-nCoV are reviewed in this article including neutralizaing antibodies, oligonucleotides, antiviral medications, and passive antibody transfer.

In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV. Potential inhibitors for 2019-nCoV coronavirus M protease from clinically approved medicines Basing on the structural information, we have predicted a list of commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors for 2019-nCoV by targeting its main protease Mpro. These drugs may also be effective for other coronaviruses with similar Mpro binding sites and pocket structures. \"Cell Pyroptosis, a Potential Pathogenic Mechanism of 2019-nCoV Infection\" The initial infection characteristics of 2019-nCoV has been reported, including the symptoms and blood test results. Cell pyroptosis is a novel inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which has been largely studied recently.

The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections Some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD \"Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCov main protease by an integrative approach combining homology modelling, molecular docking and binding free energy calculation\" This article shares progress regarding building homology models and docking small molecule drugs onto this structure.

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains. 2020, Mar 14 SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells via a novel route: CD147-spike protein The discovery of the new route CD147-SP for SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs. This study publishes a research finding that SARS-CoV-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147-spike protein (SP), mediating the viral invasion with several in vitro assays validating this result. 2020, Mar 12 A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19 A data-driven framework that combines both machine learning and statistical analysis methods was used to integrate abailable coronavirus data and identify drug candidates against the novel coronavirus.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion A SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay was used, and it was found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. A series of lipopeptides was generated and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection. 2020, Mar 10 Structure of Mpro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors This study combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening, and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro).

The built model suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially SARS and MERS. Additionally, by comparing predicted infectivity patterns, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. It was also suggested that mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov showing that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov. Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model We used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. 2020, Jan 31 Drug treatment options for the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV.

The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections Some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD \"Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCov main protease by an integrative approach combining homology modelling, molecular docking and binding free energy calculation\" This article shares progress regarding building homology models and docking small molecule drugs onto this structure.

Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir , with the binding free energy of -24.69\u00b10.52 kcal/mol and -9.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol, respectively. 2020, Jan 27 \"From SARS-CoV to Wuhan 2019-nCoV Outbreak: Similarity of Early Epidemic and Prediction of Future Trends\" The ongoing outbreak in China caused by the 2019-nCoV is very similar in many aspects to SARS in 2003. This article, using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, assesses and compares characteristics of these two outbreaks. Using the current data, the cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. It is suggested that regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent the emergence and movement of a super-spreader. \"Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCov\" This article goes into detail about the ACE2 receptor and its relation with the Wuhan 2019-nCoV. The results of thsi study indicates that ACE2 receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells, and these cells are also highly expressed with many other genes that positively regulate viral reproduction and transmission. This information may be of further use for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic research and development. 2020, Jan 24 \"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster\" The results of this study report the findings of 5 patients in a family cluster who were infected with the novel coronavirus. This study includes epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological data regarding the patients. It was found that symptoms presented 3-6 days after exposure. Additionally, it was found through next-generation sequencing that the novel coronavirus is highly related to SARS coronaviruses. \"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\" This article shares results about clinical findings regarding the 2019-nCoV. Common symptoms reported were fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue. In was interpreted that this new infection causes severe respiratory illness similar to the SARS outbreak previously. \"Genomic and protein structure modelling analysis depicts the origin and infectivity of 2019-nCoV, a new coronavirus which caused a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China\" The 2019-nCoV is revealed to be a new type of bat coronavirus and is genetically distant from the human SARS coronavirus. Its spike protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells. 2020, Jan 21 \"Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission\" Analysis showed that the Wuhan CoV shared a common ancestor with SARS coronavirus that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9-1. This work points to the RBD domain of the Wuhan CoV S-protein which supports strong interaction with human ACE2 molecules.","title":"2020"},{"location":"research_progress/#2018","text":"\"Fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome caused by an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin\" This article provides evidence that a bat coronavirus and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large outbreak resulting in the fatal disease of pigs in China.

This article reports the discovery and characterization of several small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication through several mechanisms. It showed that their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 { N -[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[( Z )-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [ N -(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane.","title":"2013"},{"location":"research_progress/#2008","text":"\"SARS coronavirus Accessory Proteins\" Evidence points to the fact that accessory proteins may play an important role in modulating the host response to virus infection and contribute to pathogenesis.
