 * [Camouﬂage and interception: how pathogens evade detection by intracellular nucleic acid sensors](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_camoflageandinterception.pdf)
    * This review article describes the interactions between pathogens and nucleic acid sensors. There are intracellular DNA and RNA sensors that induce a transcriptional response leading to the production of interferons, cytokines and chemokines. Several immune evasion strategies include sequestration of PAMPs, modification of viral RNA and DNA, and degradation and inhibition of host signalling factors. Much can be learnt from insights into the host–pathogen interactions that interfere with our cells’ defences.

    * We used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV.
    * The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). 
    * Lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM.
    * In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction.

 * [Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011v1)
    * We report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections
    * Some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD

Based on the results, there were several drugs identified based on free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for **nelfinavir**, with the binding free energy of -24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and -9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively.

 * ["From SARS-CoV to Wuhan 2019-nCoV Outbreak: Similarity of Early Epidemic and Prediction of Future Trends"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_fswncoseep.pdf)
    * The ongoing outbreak in China caused by the 2019-nCoV is very similar in many aspects  to SARS in 2003. This article, using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, assesses and compares characteristics of these two outbreaks. Using the current data, the cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. It is suggested that regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent the emergence and movement of a super-spreader.

 * ["Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCov"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_screpace2.pdf)
    * This article goes into detail about the ACE2 receptor and its relation with the Wuhan 2019-nCoV. The results of thsi study indicates that ACE2 receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells, and these cells are also highly expressed with many other genes that positively regulate viral reproduction and transmission. This information may be of further use for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic research and development.

    * The results of this study report the findings of 5 patients in a family cluster who were infected with the novel coronavirus. This study includes epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological data regarding the patients. It was found that symptoms presented 3-6 days after exposure. Additionally, it was found through next-generation sequencing that the novel coronavirus is highly related to SARS coronaviruses.

 * ["Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_cfpincv.pdf)
    * This article shares results about clinical findings regarding the 2019-nCoV. Common symptoms reported were fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue. In was interpreted that this new infection causes severe respiratory illness similar to the SARS outbreak previously.

    * The 2019-nCoV is revealed to be a new type of bat coronavirus and is genetically distant from the human SARS coronavirus. Its spike protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells.

    * There are no approved treatments as of this article for SARS coronavirus. This article reports the discovery and characterization of several small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication through several mechanisms. It showed that their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {*N*-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(*Z*)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [*N*-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane.
