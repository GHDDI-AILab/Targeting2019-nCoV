2023-04-18,'An Azapeptide Platform in Conjunction with Covalent Warheads to Uncover High-Potency Inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease',"'Main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2, the viral pathogen of COVID-19, is a crucial nonstructural protein that plays a vital role in the replication and pathogenesis of the virus. Its protease function relies on three active site pockets to recognize P1, P2, and P4 amino acid residues in a substrate and a catalytic cysteine residue for catalysis. By converting the P1 C atom in an MPro substrate to nitrogen, we showed that a large variety of azapeptide inhibitors with covalent warheads targeting the MPro catalytic cysteine could be easily synthesized. Through the characterization of these inhibitors, we identified several highly potent MPro inhibitors. Specifically, one inhibitor, MPI89 that contained an aza-2,2-dichloroacetyl warhead, displayed a 10 nM EC50 value in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 from infecting ACE2+ A549 cells and a selectivity index of 875. The crystallography analyses of MPro bound with 6 inhibitors, including MPI89, revealed that inhibitors used their covalent warheads to covalently engage the catalytic cysteine and the aza-amide carbonyl oxygen to bind to the oxyanion hole.

2023-04-18,'Evaluation of antiviral drugs against newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants',"'The ongoing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and their rapid worldwide spread pose a threat to public health. From November 2022 to February 2023, newly emerged Omicron subvariants, including BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.5.2, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, and BN.1.9, became prevalent global strains (>5% global prevalence).

A competitive surrogate neutralization assay was used to monitor vaccination success. To determine infection neutralization titers, Vero-E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC), Omicron sub-lineage BA.1, BA.5, and BQ.1.1. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50, serum dilution factor 1:x) was determined before, four weeks after and 6 months after the 4th vaccination.\n\nResults52 hemodialysis patients received four COVID-19 vaccinations and were followed up for a median of 6.3 months.

2023-03-10,'Broadly effective ACE2 decoy proteins protect mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection',"'As SARS-CoV-2 variants have been causing increasingly serious drug resistance problem, development of broadly effective and hard-to-escape anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents is in urgent need. Here we describe further development and characterization of two SARS-CoV-2 receptor decoy proteins, ACE2-Ig-95 and ACE2-Ig-105/106. We found that both proteins had potent and robust in vitro neutralization activities against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron, with an average IC50 of up to 37 pM. In a stringent lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, both proteins lowered lung viral load by up to [~]1000 fold, prevented the emergence of clinical signs in >75% animals, and increased animal survival rate from 0% (untreated) to >87.5% (treated). These results demonstrate that both proteins are good drug candidates for protecting animals from severe COVID-19. In a head-to-head comparison of these two proteins with five previously-described ACE2-Ig constructs, we found that two of these constructs, each carrying five surface mutations in the ACE2 region, had partial loss of neutralization potency against three SARS-CoV-2 variants. These data suggest that extensively mutating ACE2 residues near the RBD-binding interface should be avoided or performed with extra caution. Further, we found that both ACE2-Ig-95 and ACE2-Ig-105/106 could be produced to gram/liter level, demonstrating the developability of them as biologic drug candidates. Stress-condition stability test of them further suggests that more studies are required in the future to improve the stability of these proteins. These studies provide useful insight into critical factors for engineering and preclinical development of ACE2 decoys as broadly effective therapeutics against diverse ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses.\n\nAbstract ImportanceEngineering soluble ACE2 proteins that function as a receptor decoy to block SARS-CoV-2 infection is a very attractive approach to broadly effective and hard-to-escape anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. This study here describes development of two antibody-like soluble ACE2 proteins that broadly block diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron. In a stringent COVID-19 mouse model, both proteins successfully protected >87.5% animals from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

An interesting target for antiviral drug development is the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, a crucial early step in the replication cycle of enveloped viruses. In this study, we explored the use of cellular electrical impedance (CEI) to quantitatively monitor morphological changes in real time, resulting from cell-cell fusion elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike. The impedance signal in CEI-quantified cell-cell fusion correlated with the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 spike in transfected HEK293T cells. For antiviral assessment, we validated the CEI assay with the fusion inhibitor EK1 and measured a concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike mediated cell-cell fusion (IC50 value of 0.13 M). In addition, CEI was used to confirm the fusion inhibitory activity of the carbohydrate-binding plant lectin UDA against SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 value of 0.55 M), which complements prior in-house profiling activities.

PLpro also plays very important role in modulation of host immune responses by deubiquitinating (DUBs) or deISGylating host proteins. Thus, targeting PLpro serves as a two-pronged approach to abate SARS-CoV-2.

Although the prevalent Mpro mutants in the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (e.g., Omicron) are still susceptible to nirmatrelvir, a rare natural mutation, H172Y, was found to significantly reduce nirmatrelvirs inhibitory activity. As the selective pressure of antiviral therapy may favor resistance mutations, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of the H172Y mutation on Mpros structure, function, and drug resistance. Here we report the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well as the measurements of stability, enzyme kinetics of H172Y Mpro, and IC50 value of nirmatrelvir. Simulations showed that mutation disrupts the interactions between the S1 pocket and N terminus of the opposite protomer. Intriguingly, a native hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Phe140 and the N terminus is replaced by a transient H-bond between Phe140 and Tyr172. In the ligand-free simulations, strengthening of this nonnative H-bond is correlated with disruption of the conserved aromatic stacking between Phe140 and His163, leading to a partial collapse of the oxyanion loop. In the nirmatrelvir-bound simulations, the nonnative H-bond is correlated with the loss of an important H-bond between Glu166 and nirmatrelvirs lactam nitrogen at P1 position. These results are consistent with the newly reported X-ray structures of H172Y Mpro and suggest a mechanism by which the H172Y substitution perturbs the S1 pocket, leading to the decreased structural stability and binding affinity, which in turn explains the drastic reduction in catalytic activity and antiviral susceptibility.'",2022-08-01,'10.1101/2022.07.31.502215',http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.31.502215,82.0,'h172y mutation perturbs the s1 pocket and nirmatrelvir binding of sars cov-2 main protease through a nonnative hydrogen bond'," 'nirmatrelvir is an orally available inhibitor of sars - cov - 2 main protease ( mpro )  and the main ingredient of paxlovid ,  a drug approved by fda for high - risk covid - 19 patients. although the prevalent mpro mutants in the sars - cov - 2 variants of concern ( e.g. ,  omicron )  are still susceptible to nirmatrelvir ,  a rare natural mutation ,  h172y ,  was found to significantly reduce nirmatrelvirs inhibitory activity. as the selective pressure of antiviral therapy may favor resistance mutations ,  there is an urgent need to understand the effect of the h172y mutation on mpros structure ,  function ,  and drug resistance. here we report the molecular dynamics ( md )  simulations as well as the measurements of stability ,  enzyme kinetics of h172y mpro ,  and ic50 value of nirmatrelvir. simulations showed that mutation disrupts the interactions between the s1 pocket and n terminus of the opposite protomer. intriguingly ,  a native hydrogen bond ( h - bond )  between phe140 and the n terminus is replaced by a transient h - bond between phe140 and tyr172. in the ligand - free simulations ,  strengthening of this nonnative h - bond is correlated with disruption of the conserved aromatic stacking between phe140 and his163 ,  leading to a partial collapse of the oxyanion loop. in the nirmatrelvir - bound simulations ,  the nonnative h - bond is correlated with the loss of an important h - bond between glu166 and nirmatrelvirs lactam nitrogen at p1 position. these results are consistent with the newly reported x - ray structures of h172y mpro and suggest a mechanism by which the h172y substitution perturbs the s1 pocket ,  leading to the decreased structural stability and binding affinity ,  which in turn explains the drastic reduction in catalytic activity and antiviral susceptibility.'

It inhibits replication of a broad range of viruses, including coronaviruses, in multiple cell types, with appealing selectivity. In this work, we investigated the potential of UDA as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. UDA potently blocks entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 in A549.ACE2+-TMPRSS2 cells, with IC50 values ranging from 0.32 to 1.22 {micro}M. Furthermore, UDA prevents viral replication of the early Wuhan-Hu-1 strain in Vero E6 cells (IC50 = 225 nM), but also the replication of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta and Gamma (IC50 ranging from 115 to 171 nM). In addition, UDA exerts antiviral activity against the latest circulating Delta and Omicron variant in U87.ACE2+ cells (IC50 values are 1.6 and 0.9 {micro}M, respectively). Importantly, when tested in Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) primary lung epithelial cell cultures, UDA preserves antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (20A.EU2 variant) in the nanomolar range.

The F9-C2 fusion protein and a trivalent Rep form (C2-foldon) display 0.1 nM affinities and EC50 of 8-18 nM for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. In hamsters, F9-C2 instillation in the nasal cavity before or during infections effectively reduced the replication of a SARS-CoV-2 strain harbouring the D614G mutation in the nasal epithelium. Furthermore, F9-C2 and/or C2-foldon effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants (including delta and omicron variants) with EC50 values ranging from 13 to 32 nM. With their high stability and their high potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants, Reps provide a promising tool for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics to target the nasal cavity and mitigate virus dissemination in the proximal environment.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe entry of SARS-CoV-2 in permissive cells is mediated by the binding of its spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface.

Two of them were able to bind the RBD with high affinity and block efficiently the virus entry in cultured cells.

By introducing modifications at all four positions, we synthesized 20 boceprevir-based MPro inhibitors including PF-07321332 and characterized their MPro inhibition potency in test tubes (in vitro) and human host cells (in cellulo). Crystal structures of MPro bound with 10 inhibitors and antiviral potency of 4 inhibitors were characterized as well. Replacing the P1 site with a {beta}-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alanyl (opal) residue and the warhead with an aldehyde leads to high in vitro potency. The original moieties at P2, P3 and the P4 N-terminal cap positions in boceprevir are better than other tested chemical moieties for high in vitro potency. In crystal structures, all inhibitors form a covalent adduct with the MPro active site cysteine. The P1 opal residue, P2 dimethylcyclopropylproline and P4 N-terminal tert-butylcarbamide make strong hydrophobic interactions with MPro, explaining high in vitro potency of inhibitors that contain these moieties. A unique observation was made with an inhibitor that contains an P4 N-terminal isovaleramide.

Herein, the in vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS CoV-2 infected mice. Furthermore, the pyronaridine treated group reduced lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Notably, pyronaridine inhibited the viral PLpro activity in vitro (IC50 of 1.8 {micro}M) without any effect on Mpro, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, pyronaridine also selectively inhibits the host kinase CAMK1 (IC50 of 2.4 {micro}M).

2021-09-15,'Increased neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant by nanobody (Nb22) and the structural basis',"'Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, has become a predominant circulating variant in many countries since it first emerged in India in December 2020. Delta variant is less sensitive to serum neutralization from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, relative to Alpha strains. It was also resistant to neutralization by some anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-N-terminal domain (NTD) antibodies in clinics. Previously, we reported the discovery of nanobodies isolated from an alpaca immunized with spike protein, exhibiting ultrahigh potency against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutated variants, where a novel inhalable bispecific Nb15 protected SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 mice. Here, we found that Nb22-Fc, among our previously reported nanobodies, exhibited 8.4-fold increased neutralization potency against Delta variant with an IC50 value of 0.41 ng/ml (5.13 pM) relative to Alpha variant.

2021-08-12,'Development and utilization of a surrogate SARS-CoV-2 viral neutralization assay to assess mRNA vaccine responses.',"'BackgroundTests for SARS-CoV-2 immunity are needed to help assess responses to vaccination, which can be heterogeneous and may wane over time. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses.\n\nMethods and FindingsConfiguration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC50 results were observed (rs= .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=41 vaccinated individuals and an additional N=14 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received.

Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mefloquine have emerged as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.

To date, vaccines are available in the developed countries to prevent the infection of this virus, however, medicines are necessary to help control COVID-19. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) causes the common cold. The main protease (Mpro) is an essential enzyme required for the multiplication of these two viruses in the host cells, and thus is an appropriate candidate to screen potential medicinal compounds. Flavonols and dihydroflavonols are two groups of plant flavonoids. In this study, we report docking simulation with two Mpro enzymes and five flavonols and three dihydroflavonols, in vitro inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and in vitro inhibition of the HCoV 229E replication. The docking simulation results predicted that (+)-dihydrokaempferol, (+)-dihydroquercetin, (+)-dihydromyricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricentin, isoquercetin, and rutin could bind to at least two subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) in the binding pocket and inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Their affinity scores ranged from -8.8 to -7.4. Likewise, these compounds were predicted to bind and inhibit the HCoV-229E Mpro activity with affinity scores ranging from -7.1 to -7.8.

2021-05-01,'Relative Mutant N501Y SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD Inhibition of Anti-Spike Protein IgG and ACE-2 Binding to Spike Protein Species',"'In the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), it has become evident that the ACE-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein (SP) is the target of neutralizing antibodies that comprise a critical element of protective immunity to the virus. The most definitive confirmation of this contention is that the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in general use, which elicit antibodies specific for the RBD, exhibit approximately 95% protective efficacy against COVID-19. A potential challenge to vaccine efficacy is the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants possessing multiple mutations affecting amino acid residues in the RBD. Of concern are variants that arose in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa. One of the variants, designated B.1.351, has shown a higher transmissibility due to greater affinity for the ACE-2 receptor and decreased neutralization by convalescent plasma, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and post-vaccination plasma. Common to several of the variants is the N501Y mutation in the RBD, which may be responsible for at least part of the observed variant properties. To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of the Y501 RBD to inhibit binding of the wild type RBD and full SP (S1 + S2) to the ACE-2 protein and a human monoclonal IgG antibody elicited to the wild type RBD, relative to the wild type RBD in two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We found no significant difference in the IC50 of the two RBD species inhibition of ACE-2 binding, but unexpectedly found that the IC50 of the wild type RBD inhibition of antibody binding was nearly twice that of the Y501 RBD, reflecting a lower affinity.

Here, we screened by high-throughput docking 6,000 compounds within the DrugBank library for their potential to bind and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease, a chymotrypsin-like enzyme that is essential for viral replication. For 19 candidate hits, parallel in vitro fluorescence-based protease-inhibition assays and Vero-CCL81 cell-based SARS-CoV-2 replication-inhibition assays were performed. One hit, diclazuril (an investigational anti-protozoal compound), was validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro (IC50 value of 29 M) and modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-CCL81 cells. Another hit, lenvatinib (approved for use in humans as an anti-cancer treatment), could not be validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro, but serendipitously exhibited a striking functional synergy with the approved nucleoside analogue remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-CCL81 cells. Lenvatinib is a broadly-acting host receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, but the synergistic effect with remdesivir was not observed with other approved RTK inhibitors (such as pazopanib or sunitinib), suggesting that the mechanism-of-action is independent of host RTKs. Furthermore, time-of-addition studies revealed that lenvatinib/remdesivir synergy probably targets SARS-CoV-2 replication subsequent to host-cell entry.

One of the main drug target proteins proposed so far is the SARS-CoV-2 viral protease 3CLpro (also called Mpro), an essential component for viral replication. Ongoing ligand- and receptor-based computational screening efforts would be facilitated by an improved understanding of the electrostatic, hydrophobic and steric features that characterize small molecule inhibitors binding stably to 3CLpro, as well as by an extended collection of known binders.\n\nHere, we present combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, machine learning and in vitro experimental validation analyses which have led to the identification of small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro with micromolar activity, and to a pharmacophore model that describes functional chemical groups associated with the molecular recognition of ligands by the 3CLpro binding pocket. Experimentally validated inhibitors using a ligand activity assay include natural compounds with available prior knowledge on safety and bioavailability properties, such as the natural compound rottlerin (IC50 = 37 M), and synthetic compounds previously not characterized (e.g. compound CID 46897844, IC50 = 31 M).

PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors.

However, many issues associated with the vaccines and the protection they provide remain unresolved, including the duration of conferred immunity, whether or not sterilizing immunity is imparted, and the degree of cross-variant protection that is achieved with these vaccines. Early evidence has suggested potentially reduced vaccine efficacy towards certain viral variants in circulation. Development of adjuvants compatible with these vaccine platforms that enhance the immune response and guide the adaptive and cellular immune responses towards the types of responses most effective for broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 will likely be pivotal for complete protection. Natural viral infection stimulates strong immune responses through the activation of three main pathways involving Toll-, RIG-I-, and NOD-like receptors (TLRs, RLRs, NLRs). As induction of appropriate innate responses is crucial for long-lasting adaptive immunity and for shaping the correct types of immune responses, we developed a combination, intranasal, adjuvant integrating a nanoemulsion-based adjuvant (NE) that activates TLRs and NLRP3 with an RNA agonist of RIG-I (IVT DI). This rationally designed combination adjuvant yielded a synergistic immune response with highly robust humoral and cellular responses towards SARS-CoV-2 using a recombinant spike protein S1 subunit antigen. Significantly enhanced virus neutralizing antibody titers were achieved towards both a homologous SARS-CoV-2 virus (IC50 titers of 1:104) and a mouse-adapted variant containing the N501Y mutation present in the B1.1.7 UK and B.1.351 South Africa variants. Importantly, NE/IVT DI dramatically enhanced the TH1-biased cellular response, which is expected to provide more durable and tailored cellular immunity while avoiding potential vaccine enhanced pathology previously associated with TH2-biased responses in some SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines. Our previous work with the NE/IVT DI adjuvant has demonstrated its compatibility with a broad range of antigen types.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the disease uses RNA capping to evade the human immune system. Non-structural protein (nsp) 14 is one of the 16 nsps in SARS-CoV-2 and catalyzes the methylation of the viral RNA at N7-guanosine in the cap formation process. To discover small molecule inhibitors of nsp14 methyltransferase (MT) activity, we developed and employed a radiometric MT assay to screen a library of 161 in house synthesized S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) competitive methyltransferase inhibitors and SAM analogs. Among seven identified screening hits, SS148 inhibited nsp14 MT activity with an IC50 value of 70 {+/-} 6 nM and was selective against 20 human protein lysine methyltransferases indicating significant differences in SAM binding sites. Interestingly, DS0464 with IC50 value of 1.1 {+/-} 0.2 M showed a bi-substrate competitive inhibitor mechanism of action.

To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in exposed participants. Setting Two acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of England. Background The UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current literature. Methods Healthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs. Results 633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). 7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%. 110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50 1/300 dilution; no cohabitee achieved this level.

For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed.\n\nMethodsA label-free surrogate neutralization assay (LF-sVNT) was established on the TFI label-free immunoassay analyzer to measure neutralizing antibody titers in serum samples. The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of RBD to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum.\n\nResultsThe LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (IC50) were determined from serum samples (n=246) from COVID-19 patients (n=113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. There is considerable variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentration and neutralizing titer between individuals, however, there is an initial rise, plateau and then in some cases a gradual decline at later timepoints after 40 days post-symptom onset. The IgG avidity, in the same cases, plateaued after the initial rise and did not show a corresponding decline with IgG concentration and neutralizing ability.\n\nConclusionsThe LF-sVNT can be valuable tool in clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau and then remains constant up to 8 months post-infection.

Efficacy is observed against the six viral families causing most human respiratory viral disease, irrespective of strain, including both influenza (FLUV) and SARS-CoV-2, with cell culture EC50 at or below 100 nM. Survival benefit is demonstrated in pigs against another member of family Coronaviridae, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and shown equally effective in mild and severe disease. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) titer is reduced by drug treatment in cotton rats. A substantial barrier to viral resistance is demonstrated for FLUV. Drug resin affinity chromatography (DRAC) reveals a novel drug target: a multi-protein complex (MPC) formed transiently, in an energy-dependent fashion, and composed of host proteins implicated in both viral lifecycles and manipulation of innate immunity. The protein composition of this host MPC is modified upon viral infection, with increase or decrease of some proteins and appearance or complete loss of others. Valosin-containing protein, also known as Transitional endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97), is present in the target MPC of uninfected cells and significantly increased in both FLUV and CoV infection.

Investigation has confirmed that polysaccharide heparan sulfate can bind to the spike protein and block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Theoretically, similar structure of nature polysaccharides may also have the impact on the virus. Indeed, some marine polysaccharide has been reported to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 infection in vitro, however the convinced targets and mechanism are still vague. By high throughput screening to target 3CLpro enzyme, a key enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the viral replication and transcription using nature polysaccharides library, we discover the mixture polysaccharide 375 from seaweed Ecklonia kurome completely block 3CLpro enzymatic activity (IC50, 0.48 M). Further, the homogeneous polysaccharide 37502 from the 375 may bind to 3CLpro molecule well (kD value: 4.23x10-6). Very interestingly, 37502 also can potently disturb Spike protein binding to ACE2 receptor (EC50, 2.01 M).

One sample was >12 years old, but still active. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts and antiviral efficacy was inversely correlated to artemisinin and total flavonoid contents. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 M, and antimalarial artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations.

Using this system, we identified nine compounds, specifically, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC50 values of 0.1-10 M. Mechanistic studies showed that these compounds, reported as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), inhibited Ca2+-mediated membrane fusion and consequently suppressed coronavirus entry.

2020-12-07,'LL-37 fights SARS-CoV-2: The Vitamin D-Inducible Peptide LL-37 Inhibits Binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein to its Cellular Receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 In Vitro',"Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen accountable for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Viral entry via binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) located within the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein to its target receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key step in cell infection. The efficient transition of the virus is linked to a unique protein called open reading frame (ORF) 8. As SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop into life threatening lower respiratory syndromes, effective therapy options are urgently needed. Several publications propose vitamin D treatment, although its mode of action against COVID-19 is not fully elucidated. It is speculated that vitamin D's beneficial effects are mediated by up regulating LL-37, a well known antimicrobial peptide with antiviral effects. Methods: Recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein, the extended S1 subunit (S1e), the S2 subunit (S2), the receptor binding domain (RBD), and ORF8 were used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies to investigate LL-37's ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and to localize its binding site within the S protein. Binding competition studies were conducted to confirm an inhibitory action of LL-37 on the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to its entry receptor ACE2. Results: We could show that LL-37 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein (LL-37/S-Strep KD = 407 nM, LL-37/S-His KD = 414 nM) with the same affinity, as SARS-CoV-2 binds to hACE2 (hACE2/S-Strep KD = 374 nM, hACE2/S-His KD = 368 nM). The binding is not restricted to the RBD of the S protein, but rather distributed along the entire length of the protein. Interaction between LL-37 and ORF8 was detected with a KD of 294 nM. Further, inhibition of the binding of S-Strep (IC50 = 735 nM), S1e (IC50 = 168 nM), and RBD (IC50 = 126 nM) to hACE2 by LL-37 was demonstrated. Conclusions: We have revealed a biochemical link between vitamin D, LL-37, and COVID-19 severity. SPR analysis demonstrated that LL-37 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and inhibits binding to its receptor hACE2, and most likely viral entry into the cell. This study supports the prophylactic use of vitamin D to induce LL-37 that protects from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the therapeutic administration of vitamin D for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

2020-11-21,Inhibition of S-protein RBD and hACE2 Interaction for Control of SARSCoV-2 Infection (COVID-19).,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become pandemic with higher morbidity and mortality rates after its start from Wuhan city of China. The infection by RNA virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV, from beta class of corona viruses has been found to be responsible for COVID-19. Structural analysis and evidences have been indicated that interaction between a segment of receptor binding domain (RBD) from S protein of virus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is essential for cellular entry of virus.
OBJECTIVE: The current review put the light on structural aspects for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction mediated cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: The present study provides a critical review of recently published information on RBD-hACE2 interaction and its inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review highlighted the structural aspects of interaction between RBDhACE2 and involved amino acid residues.
RESULTS: Recently, several studies are being conducted for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the human cellular system. One of the important targets for viral invasion is its binding with cell surface receptor, hACE2, through RBD on S-protein. Mimicking of three residues on ACE2 (Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain) provided hot target directed strategy for inhibition of early attachment of virus to the cell. Early screening of peptidic or non-peptidic molecules for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction has been raised the hope for potential therapeutics against COVID-19. The higher affinity of molecules toward RBD than ACE2 is important factor for selectivity and minimization of ACE2 related adverse events on cardiovascular system, brain, kidney, and foetus development during pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: Inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction by different molecular scaffolds can be used as a preferred strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, published reports pointed out Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain of ACE2 as crucial residues for mimicking and design of novel molecules as inhibitors SARS-CoV-2 attachment to human cells. Moreover, some recently identified RBD-hACE2 interaction inhibitors have also been described with their protein binding pattern and potencies (IC50 values) which will help for further improvement in the selectivity.",2020-11-17,10.2174/1389557520666201117111259,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132747391,"

There have been multiple reports of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases following SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are several suggested mechanisms involved in the development of autoimmune diseases, including cross-reactivity (molecular mimicry). A typical workflow for discovering cross-reactive epitopes (mimotopes) starts with a sequence similarity search between protein sequences of human and a pathogen. However, sequence similarity information alone is not enough to predict cross-reactivity between proteins since proteins can share highly similar conformational epitopes whose amino acid residues are situated far apart in the linear protein sequences. Therefore, we used a hidden Markov model-based tool to identify distant viral homologs of human proteins. Also, we utilized experimentally determined and modeled protein structures of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins to find homologous protein structures between them. Next, we predicted binding affinity (IC50) of potentially cross-reactive T-cell epitopes to 34 MHC allelic variants that have been associated with autoimmune diseases using multiple prediction algorithms.

2020-11-11,480 Preliminary evaluation of a novel coronavirus vaccine (CORVax) using electroporation of plasmid DNA encoding a stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone or with transfection of plasmid IL-12," Background  SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) has precipitated a global pandemic and the effectiveness of standard vaccine strategies to induce potent and persistent immunity to CoV2 is in question, particularly for the elderly. This problem is not dissimilar to what we have struggled with in our quest to induce immunity to cancer antigens, where vaccine-induced anti-cancer immune responses can be weak. Here, we describe a novel vaccine approach which leverages electroporation (EP) of a plasmid encoding a prefusion stabilized CoV2 spike protein (CORVax). As IL-12 has been shown to augment the efficacy of immunotherapy in aged mice, 1 we have initiated studies to evaluate if plasmid IL-12 (TAVO™) can similarly augment anti-CoV2 immune responses in young mice and have planned studies in aged animals.    Methods A prefusion stabilized CoV2 spike plasmid expression vector was constructed, a master cell bank generated and clinical-grade plasmid manufactured. C57BL/6 and BALB/c were vaccinated via intramuscular (IM) and/or intradermal (ID) injection followed immediately by EP of plasmids encoding the CoV2 spike protein with or without plasmid-encoded murine IL-12 on days 1 and 14 or 21. Mice were followed for >120 days to assess safety. Splenocytes and serum were harvested at different time points to interrogate virus-specific cellular responses as well anti-spike IgG1/IgG2 antibody titers. A surrogate viral neutralization test (sVNT) assessed serum blockade of soluble hACE2R binding to immobilized CoV2 spike.   Results Preliminary data shows that EP of CORVax alone or combined with IL-12 was safe. EP of CORVax was able to elicit anti-Spike IgG antibodies (IC50 = 1/2112), as well as IgG antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein (IC50 = 1/965) approximately 40 days after the booster vaccination. In 2 of 2 experiments, CORVax combined with IL-12 significantly (P<0.0001) increased the sVNT titers at 2 months, but this benefit was lost by 3 months.   Conclusions Early preclinical data shows that EP of CORVax can induce IgG responses to CoV2 Spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as apparent viral neutralizing activity. The addition of IL-12, at least transiently, increased sVNT titer. We plan to investigate alternate vaccine boosting strategies while extending these studies into aged animals and initiate a clinical trial in the near future.   References    Ruby CE, Weinberg AD.

2020-11-07,Bovine Interferon Lambda Is a Potent Antiviral Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in vitro,"Interferon lambda (IFN-λ) is an antiviral naturally produced in response to viral infections, with activity on cells of epithelial origin and located in the mucosal surfaces. This localized activity results in reduced toxicity compared to type I IFNs, whose receptors are ubiquitously expressed. IFN-λ has been effective in the therapy of respiratory viral infections, playing a crucial role in potentiating adaptive immune responses that initiate at mucosal surfaces. Human IFN-λ has polymorphisms that may cause differences in the interaction with the specific receptor in the human population. Interestingly, bovine IFN-λ3 has an in silico-predicted higher affinity for the human receptor than its human counterparts, with high identity with different human IFN-λ variants, making it a suitable antiviral therapeutic candidate for human health. Here, we demonstrate that a recombinant bovine IFN-λ (rbIFN-λ) produced in HEK-293 cells is effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells, with an inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) between 30 and 50 times lower than that of human type I IFN tested here (α2b and β1a). We also demonstrated the absence of toxicity of rbIFN-λ in human PBMCs and the lack of proinflammatory activity on these cells. Altogether, our results show that rbIFN-λ is as an effective antiviral potentially suitable for COVID-19 therapy. Among other potential applications, rbIFN-λ could be useful to preclude virus dispersion to the lungs and/or to reduce transmission from infected people.

2020-11-02,"Role of Chikungunya nsP3 in Regulating G3BP1 Activity, Stress Granule Formation and Drug Efficacy","BACKGROUND: Ras-GTPase activating protein SH3-domain-binding proteins (G3BP) are a small family of RNA-binding proteins implicated in regulating gene expression. Changes in expression of G3BPs are correlated to several cancers including thyroid, colon, pancreatic and breast cancer. G3BPs are important regulators of stress granule (SG) formation and function. SG are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that respond to cellular stresses to triage mRNA resulting in transcripts being selectively degraded, stored or translated resulting in a change of gene expression which confers a survival response to the cell. These changes in gene expression contribute to the development of drug resistance. Many RNA viruses, including Chikungunya (and potentially Coronavirus), dismantle SG so that the cell cannot respond to the viral infection. Non-structural protein 3 (nsP3), from the Chikungunya virus, has been shown to translocate G3BP away from SG. Interestingly in cancer cells, the formation of SG is correlated to drug-resistance and blocking SG formation has been shown to reestablish the efficacy of the anticancer drug bortezomib.
METHODS: Chikungunya nsP3 was transfected into breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 to disrupt SG formation. Changes in the cytotoxicity of bortezomib were measured.
RESULTS: Bortezomib cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines changed with a 22 fold decrease in its IC50 for T47D and a 7 fold decrease for MCF7 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Chikungunya nsP3 disrupts SG formation. As a result, it increases the cytotoxicity of the FDA approved drug, bortezomib.

2020-10-31,Unfractionated heparin inhibits live wild‐type SARS‐CoV‐2 cell infectivity at therapeutically relevant concentrations,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Currently there are no licensed vaccines and limited antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Heparin (delivered systemically) is currently used to treat anticoagulant anomalies in COVID-19 patients. In addition, in the UK, Brazil and Australia, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) is being trialled in COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment. A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild-type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry, and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using ELISA assays was examined.
KEY RESULTS: All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25-41 μg ml-1 whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4 - 7.8 mg ml-1 ). Mechanistically we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein, and furthermore we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor.

Virus load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 2000029544).
RESULTS: Baloxavir acid showed antiviral activity in vitro with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5.48 μM comparable to arbidol and lopinavir, but favipiravir didn't demonstrate significant antiviral activity up to 100 μM. Thirty patients were enrolled. The percentage of patients who turned viral negative after 14-day treatment was 70%, 77%, and 100% in the baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, and control group respectively, with the medians of time from randomization to clinical improvement was 14, 14 and 15 days, respectively. One reason for the lack of virological effect and clinical benefits may be due to insufficient concentrations of these drugs relative to their antiviral activities. One of the limitations of this study is the time from symptom onset to randomization, especially in the baloxavir marboxil and control groups, which is higher than the favipiravir group.

2020-10-07,In vitro efficacy of Artemisinin-based treatments against SARS-CoV-2,"Abstract  Effective and affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are needed. We report in vitro efficacy of Artemisia annua extracts as well as artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether against SARS-CoV-2. The latter two are approved active pharmaceutical ingredients of anti-malarial drugs.  Proof-of-concept for prophylactic efficacy of the extracts was obtained using a plaque-reduction assay in VeroE6 cells. Subsequent concentration-response studies using a high-throughput antiviral assay, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed that pretreatment and treatment with extracts, artemisinin, and artesunate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. In treatment assays, artesunate (50% effective concentration (EC50): 7 μg/mL) was more potent than the tested plant extracts (128-260 μg/mL) or artemisinin (151 μg/mL) and artemether (>179 μg/mL), while generally EC50 in pretreatment assays were slightly higher. The selectivity index (SI), calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, was highest for artemisinin (54), and roughly equal for the extracts (5-10), artesunate (6) and artemether (<7).

Additionally, such binders provide the unique possibility to monitor the emergence and presence of a neutralizing immune response in infected or vaccinated individuals. Here we describe a set of 11 unique nanobodies (Nbs), originated from an immunized alpaca which bind with high affinities to the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor domain (RBD). Using a multiplex in vitro binding assay we showed that eight of the selected Nbs effectively block the interaction between RBD, S1-domain and homotrimeric Spike protein with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the viral docking site on human cells. According to competitive binding analysis and detailed epitope mapping, we grouped all Nbs blocking the RBD:ACE2 interaction in three distinct Nb-Sets and demonstrated their neutralizing effect with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range in a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Tested Nb combinations from different sets showed substantially lower IC50 values in both functional assays indicating a profound synergistic effect of Nbs simultaneously targeting different epitopes within the RBD. Finally, we applied the most potent Nb combinations in a competitive multiplex binding assay which we termed NeutrobodyPlex and detected a neutralizing immune response in plasma samples of infected individuals.

2020-09-28,"Safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine candidate: interim results of a phase 1/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial"," BACKGROUND The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively.

Therefore, repurposing of known drugs to inhibit S protein-ACE2 interaction could be a quick way to develop effective therapy for COVID-19. Using a high-throughput screening system to investigate the interaction between spike receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 extracellular domain, we screened 3581 FDA-approved drugs and natural small molecules and identified ceftazidime as a potent compound to inhibit S-RBD-ACE2 interaction by binding to S-RBD. In addition to significantly inhibit S-RBD binding to HPAEpiC cells, ceftazidime efficiently prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to infect ACE2-expressing 293T cells. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 113.2 M, which is far below the blood concentration (over 300 M) of ceftazidime in patients when clinically treated with recommended dose.

All substances were not originally developed for the treatment of COVID-19 and especially for GS-441 524 little is known about its pharmacokinetic and physical-chemical properties. To justify the application of new or repurposed drugs in humans, pre-clinical in vivo animal models are mandatory to investigate relevant PK and PD properties and their relationship to each other. In this study, an adapted mouse model was chosen to demonstrate its suitability to provide sufficient information on the model substances GS-441 524 and HCQ regarding plasma concentration and distribution into relevant tissues a prerequisite for treatment effectiveness.\n\nMethodsGS-441 524 and HCQ were administered intravenously as a single injection to male mice.

2020-09-19,"'Ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin are non-specific promiscuous SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors'","'There is an urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging progress has been made in developing antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Among the drug targets being investigated, the viral main protease (Mpro) is one of the most extensively studied drug targets. Mpro is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites and it is highly conserved among coronaviruses. In addition, Mpro has a unique substrate preference for glutamine in the P1 position. Taken together, it appears that Mpro inhibitors can achieve both broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index. Structurally diverse compounds have been reported as Mpro inhibitors, with several of which also showed antiviral activity in cell culture. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported Mpro inhibitors, ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 using a consortium of techniques including FRET-based enzymatic assay, thermal shift assay, native mass spectrometry, cellular antiviral assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. Collectively, the results showed that the inhibition of Mpro by these six compounds is non-specific and the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing reagent DTT. In the absence of DTT, these six compounds not only inhibit Mpro, but also a panel of viral cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, the 2Apro and 3Cpro from enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and EV-D68. However, none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of EV-A71 or EV-D68, suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 values obtained in the absence of DTT cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity. Overall, we provide compelling evidence suggesting that ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 are non-specific SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=""FIGDIR/small/299164v1_ufig1.gif"" ALT=""Figure 1"">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e47301org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a5a16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f077b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@42dde1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG'",2020-09-16,'10.1101/2020.09.15.299164',http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.299164,40.0,"'ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, px-12, tideglusib, and shikonin are non-specific promiscuous sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors'"," 'there is an urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat the covid - 19 pandemic. encouraging progress has been made in developing antivirals targeting sars - cov - 2 ,  the etiological agent of covid - 19. among the drug targets being investigated ,  the viral main protease ( mpro )  is one of the most extensively studied drug targets. mpro is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites and it is highly conserved among coronaviruses. in addition ,  mpro has a unique substrate preference for glutamine in the p1 position. taken together ,  it appears that mpro inhibitors can achieve both broad - spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index. structurally diverse compounds have been reported as mpro inhibitors ,  with several of which also showed antiviral activity in cell culture. in this study ,  we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported mpro inhibitors ,  ebselen ,  disulfiram ,  tideglusib ,  carmofur ,  shikonin ,  and px - 12 using a consortium of techniques including fret - based enzymatic assay ,  thermal shift assay ,  native mass spectrometry ,  cellular antiviral assays ,  and molecular dynamics simulations. collectively ,  the results showed that the inhibition of mpro by these six compounds is non - specific and the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing reagent dtt. in the absence of dtt ,  these six compounds not only inhibit mpro ,  but also a panel of viral cysteine proteases including sars - cov - 2 papain - like protease ,  the 2apro and 3cpro from enterovirus a71 ( ev - a71 )  and ev - d68. however ,  none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of ev - a71 or ev - d68 ,  suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency ic50 values obtained in the absence of dtt cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity. overall ,  we provide compelling evidence suggesting that ebselen ,  disulfiram ,  tideglusib ,  carmofur ,  shikonin ,  and px - 12 are non - specific sars - cov - 2 mpro inhibitors ,  and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation.  o_fig o_linksmallfig width=200 height=92 src=""figdir small 299164v1_ufig1.gif"" alt=""figure 1""> view larger version ( 13k ) : org.highwire.dtl.dtlvardef@1e47301org.highwire.dtl.dtlvardef@13a5a16org.highwire.dtl.dtlvardef@1f077b4org.highwire.dtl.dtlvardef@42dde1_hps_format_figexp  m_fig c_fig' ","[[' however ,  none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of ev - a71 or ev - d68 ,  suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency ic50 values obtained in the absence of dtt cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity.']]"

The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro.

2020-09-05,Association between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and commercial serological assays,"INTRODUCTION: Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there are limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.
METHODS: 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) & 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) & 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) & 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who were intubated, had cardiac injury, or acute kidney injury from COVID-19 infection had higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.",2020-09-07,10.1093/clinchem/hvaa211,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130577672,"

In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 μg/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2–SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

2020-08-17,Quantifying absolute neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 by a standardized virus neutralization assay allows for cross-cohort comparisons of COVID-19 sera.,"The on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has mobilized a global effort to develop vaccines and therapeutics that inhibit viral entry by inducing or transferring antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (CoV2-S). Phase I/II vaccine clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent sera have all shown promise. However, these efforts often require extensive screening with the live virus under onerous high biocontainment conditions (BSL-3). Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) remain the gold standard for evaluating the anti-viral potency of antibodies and entry inhibitors. The proliferation of pseudotyped virus systems that can be used in BSL-2 compatible VNAs is a positive development. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how the findings are presented, making inter-group comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using VSVdeltaG based CoV-2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) that can be robustly produced at scale. We used our CoV2pp to interrogate the role of exogenous and endogenous proteases in CoV-2-S mediated entry and standardized our VNA based on that understanding. Our CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S ELISA and live virus neutralizations in a validated set of patient sera. Our system was subsequently validated by three independent groups as an out-of-the-box VNA. More than 120 patient sera were screened, and we report descriptive statistics for absolute (abs) IC50, IC80, and IC90 values from all positive patient sera.

The effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine towards COVID-19 in the in vitro experiment showed it could inhibit the duplication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The chloroquine function is to stop COVID-19 infection with (EC50) 1,13 μM and (CC50) larger than 100 μM. Meanwhile, the hydroxychloroquine function is to inhibit the attachment and entry of the virus into the host’s cell by enzymatic activation which is the lysosome acidification disorder and antigen presentation as the result of pH increase.

2020-08-04,Engineered ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2.,"An essential mechanism for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human Fc domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the tens of ng/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be pre-designed for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated or generated from convalescent patients.",2020-08-01,10.1101/2020.07.31.231746,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129836539,"

2020-07-29,'A Speedy Route to Multiple Highly Potent SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors',"'The COVID-19 pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, requires its main protease (SC2MPro) to digest two of its translated polypeptides to form a number of mature proteins that are essential for viral replication and pathogenesis. Inhibition of this vital proteolytic process is effective in preventing the virus from replication in infected cells and therefore provides a potential COVID-19 treatment option. Guided by previous medicinal chemistry studies about SARS-CoV-1 main protease (SC1MPro), we have designed and synthesized a series of SC2MPro inhibitors that contain beta-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal (Opal) for the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the SC2MPro active site cysteine C145. All inhibitors display high potency with IC50 values at or below 100 nM. The most potent compound MPI3 has as an IC50 value as 8.5 nM. Crystallographic analyses of SC2MPro bound to 7 inhibitors indicated both formation of a covalent bond with C145 and structural rearrangement from the apoenzyme to accommodate the inhibitors. Virus inhibition assays revealed that several inhibitors have high potency in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in both Vero E6 and A549 cells. Two inhibitors MP5 and MPI8 completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in Vero E6 cells at 2.5-5 uM and A549 cells at 0.16-0.31 uM.

This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: LPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered 12 hourly, 800/200 mg on day 1, and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. Results: The median age of study participants was 59 (range 24 up to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4;10) and 8 days (IQR 5;10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 ug/mL (IQR 18.9;31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.37, p<0.001), and were significantly lower when tocilizumab was preadministrated.

Drug repurposing screening is the most practical and rapid approach for discovery of such therapeutics. The 3CLpro, or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a viral enzyme with an essential role in viral replication, and cleavage specificity that is distinct from host proteases.\n\nExperimental ApproachWe employed and miniaturized a fluorogenic 3CLpro enzyme assay in which 3CLpro cleaves a quenched peptide substrate and releases a fluorescent fragment, resulting an increase in fluorescence signal. By using this SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay, we conducted a qHTS of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds, at 4 compound concentrations. The confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors were also tested in a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay to determine their effects on rescuing of cell death caused by the virus infection.\n\nKey ResultsTwenty-seven small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 27.1 M with a greater than 80% maximal inhibition.

2020-07-18,Ligand and Structure-based Virtual Screening of Lamiaceae Diterpenes with Potential Activity against a Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of a new coronavirus (CoV), named 2019-nCoV, as an outbreak originated in the city of Wuhan, China, has resulted in the death of more than 3,400 people this year alone and has caused worldwide an alarming situation, particularly following previous CoV epidemics, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Currently, no exists for infections caused by CoVs; however, some natural products may represent potential treatment resources, such as those that contain diterpenes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use computational methods to perform a virtual screening (VS) of candidate diterpenes with the potential to act as CoV inhibitors.
METHODS: 1,955 diterpenes, derived from the Nepetoideae subfamily (Lamiaceae), were selected using the SistematX tool (https://sistematx.ufpb.br), which were used to make predictions. From the ChEMBL database, 3 sets of chemical structures were selected for the construction of predictive models.
RESULTS: The chemical structures of molecules with known activity against SARS CoV, two of which were tested for activity against specific viral proteins and one of which was tested for activity against the virus itself, were classified according to their pIC50 values [-log IC50 (mol/l)].

2020-07-17,Review of safety and minimum pricing of nitazoxanide for potential treatment of COVID-19," Background Many treatments are being assessed for repurposing to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC50) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cmax: EC50roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. Methods A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5–14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1–4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. Results Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited. Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. Conclusion Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated.

2020-07-13,A drug repurposing screen identifies hepatitis C antivirals as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"Abstract  The SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible between humans that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic 1,2 . This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be ∼2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4 . Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of ∼6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro . In our primary screen we found ∼50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 ≤ 50 μM. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 μM), Ciluprevir (20.77μM). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10μM), and Telaprevir (15.25μM). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.

2020-07-12,Energetics and IC50 based epitope screening in SARS CoV-2 (COVID 19) spike protein by immunoinformatic analysis implicating for a suitable vaccine development,"BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 has generated a chaos in global health and economy and claimed/infected a large number of lives. Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time.
METHODS: Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects.
RESULTS: We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, Inhibitory Concentration50 (IC50), MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition.

This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: LPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered 12 hourly, 800/200 mg on day 1, and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. Results: The median age of study participants was 59 (range 24 up to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4;10) and 8 days (IQR 5;10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 ug/mL (IQR 18.9;31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.37, p<0.001), and were significantly lower when tocilizumab was preadministrated. No correlation was found between HCQ concentrations and CRP values. Conclusions: High LPV plasma concentrations were observed in COVID-19 patients.

Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target. In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 M and 0.04 M respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.42 M and 0.33 M, respectively.

However, no comprehensive evaluation of these molecules in the context of the achievable plasma pharmacokinetics after administration of approved doses and schedules to humans has been conducted. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of these drugs demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date is of variable quality and conducted under different conditions by different investigators. However, this analysis has prioritised candidates with the best chance for success in therapy or chemoprevention of Covid-19 based upon the currently available in vitro activity and human plasma pharmacokinetic data.

However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies. Methods: 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes. Results: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82).

Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy.\n\nMethodsThe neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%).\n\nResultsAll IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3.

2020-07-03,'An Enzymatic TMPRSS2 Assay for Assessment of Clinical Candidates and Discovery of Inhibitors as Potential Treatment of COVID-19',"'SARS-CoV-2 is the viral pathogen causing the COVID19 global pandemic. Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (""priming"") that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. This fusion event is proceeded by release of viral RNA within the host cell. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. Additionally, knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated reduced infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 with no detectable physiological impact; thus, TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan for pancreatitis due to their inhibition of trypsin-like proteases.

Method: Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 ug/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Results: Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC50, even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose.

To date, no effective therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19.

Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively).

Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation.

2020-06-08,SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human recombinant antibodies selected from pre-pandemic healthy donors binding at RBD-ACE2 interface,"Abstract COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus discovered in December 2019 and closely related to the SARS coronavirus (CoV). Both viruses use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry, recognizing it with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike (S) protein. The S2 domain mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Experience with SARS and MERS coronaviruses has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS) and block the virus cell entry. Assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against SARS-CoV-2, we used phage display to select from the human naïve universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction with ACE2. 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1 were identified. 17 showed more than 75% inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2 in the scFv-Fc format, assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50% inhibition at a molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or RBD of 1:1.

2020-05-24,Repurposing old drugs as antiviral agents for coronaviruses,"BACKGROUND: New therapeutic options to address the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are urgently needed. One possible strategy is the repurposing of existing drugs approved for other indications as antiviral agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the commercial unavailability of SARS-CoV-2 drugs for treating COVID-19, we screened approximately 250 existing drugs or pharmacologically active compounds for their inhibitory activities against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), a human coronavirus in the same genus (Betacoronavirus) as SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: FIPV was proliferated in feline Fcwf-4 cells and HCoV-OC43 in human HCT-8 cells. Viral proliferation was assayed by visualization of cytopathic effects on the infected Fcwf-4 cells and immunofluorescent assay for detection of the nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-OC43 in the HCT-8 cells. The concentrations (EC50) of each drug necessary to diminish viral activity to 50% of that for the untreated controls were determined. The viabilities of Fcwf-4 and HCT-8 cells were measured by crystal violet staining and MTS/PMS assay, respectively.
RESULTS: Fifteen out of the 252 drugs or pharmacologically active compounds screened were found to be active against both FIPV and HCoV-OC43, with EC50 values ranging from 11 nM to 75 μM. They are all old drugs as follows, anisomycin, antimycin A, atovaquone, chloroquine, conivaptan, emetine, gemcitabine, homoharringtonine, niclosamide, nitazoxanide, oligomycin, salinomycin, tilorone, valinomycin, and vismodegib.
CONCLUSION: All of the old drugs identified as having activity against FIPV and HCoV-OC43 have seen clinical use in their respective indications and are associated with known dosing schedules and adverse effect or toxicity profiles in humans.

2020-05-15,Remdesivir Potently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in Human Lung Cells and Chimeric SARS-CoV Expressing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA Polymerase in Mice,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 as the causative agent of the novel pandemic viral disease COVID-19. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 µM). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 µM) due to their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.Funding: This project was funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National 284 Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Service awards: 1U19AI142759 (Antiviral Drug 285 Discovery and Development Center awarded to M.R.D. and R.S.B); 5R01AI132178 awarded to T.P.S. 286 and R.S.B.; and 5R01AI108197 awarded to M.R.D. and R.S.B.

2020-05-11,Inhibition of the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells by the FDA-approved drug chlorpromazine,"Abstract  Urgent action is needed to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), the prototype of typical antipsychotics from the phenothiazine group, is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and acts as an antiviral, in particular against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. In this study, we describe the in vitro testing of CPZ against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in monkey and human cells. We evidenced an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of ∼10μM. Because of its high biodistribution in lung, saliva and brain, such IC50 measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosage used in clinical routine. This extrapolation is in line with our observations of a higher prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections among health care professionals compared to patients in psychiatric wards. These preclinical findings support the repurposing of CPZ, a largely used drug with mild side effects, in COVID-19 treatment.

2020-04-30,Pre-clinical search of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and their combinations in approved drugs to tackle COVID-19 pandemic,"ABSTRACT  There is an urgent need to identify novel drugs against the new coronavirus. Although different antivirals are given for the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection, their efficacy is still under evaluation. Here, we have screened existing drugs approved for human use in a variety of diseases, to compare how they counteract SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect and viral replication in vitro . Among the potential 72 antivirals tested herein that were previously proposed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, only 18% had in vitro antiviral activity. Moreover, only eight families had an IC50 below 25 µM or 10 2 IU/mL. These include chloroquine derivatives and remdesivir, along with plitidepsin, cathepsin inhibitors, nelfinavir mesylate hydrate, interferon 2-alpha, interferon-gamma, fenofibrate and camostat.

Since the most effective antivirals usually combine therapies that tackle the virus at different steps of infection, we also assessed several drug combinations. Although no particular synergy was found, inhibitory combinations did not reduce their antiviral activity. Thus, these combinations could decrease the potential emergence of resistant viruses.

2020-04-30,Hydroxychloroquine as an aerosol might markedly reduce and even prevent severe clinical symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10%. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 h after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 µM at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.",2020-09-01,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109783,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127147060,"

2020-04-30,The Approved Dose of Ivermectin Alone is not the Ideal Dose for the Treatment of COVID-19,"Introduction: Caly, Druce (1) reported that ivermectin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro for up to 48 h using ivermectin at 5 uM. The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50, 2 uM) was >35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Method: Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 ug/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Results: Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC50, even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose. Even with higher exposure in lungs than plasma, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC50 in lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0857 uM) or at doses 10x higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.817 uM). Conclusions: The likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low. Combination therapy should be evaluated in vitro.

To further uncover the toxicity profile of CQ and HCQ in different tissues, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of them in 8 cell lines, and further adopted the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) to predict the tissue risk respectively. Retina, myocardium, lung, liver, kidney, vascular endothelium and intestinal epithelium originated cells were included in the toxicity evaluation of CQ and HCQ respectively. The proliferation pattern was monitored in 0-72 hours by IncuCyte S3, which could perform long-term continuous image and video of cells upon CQ or HCQ treatment. CC50 and the ratio of tissue trough concentrations to CC50 (R TTCC ) were brought into predicted toxicity profiles. The CC50 at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h of CQ and HCQ decreased in the time-dependent manner, which indicates the accumulative cytotoxic effect. HCQ was found to be less toxic in 7 cell types except cardiomyocytes H9C2 cells (CC50-48 h=29.55 μM; CC50-72 h=15.26 μM). In addition, R TTCC is significant higher in CQ treatment group compared to HCQ group, which indicates that relative safety of HCQ. Both CQ and HCQ have certain cytotoxicity in time dependent manner which indicates the necessity of short period administration clinically. HCQ has the less impact in 7 cell lines proliferation and less toxicity compared to CQ in heart, liver, kidney and lung.

2020-04-24,Prioritisation of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on ability to achieve adequate target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics,"Many papers are emerging that describe the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, no comprehensive evaluation of these molecules in the context of the achievable plasma pharmacokinetics after administration of approved doses and schedules to humans has been conducted. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of these drugs demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date is of variable quality and conducted under different conditions by different investigators. However, this analysis has prioritised candidates with the best chance for success in therapy or chemoprevention of Covid-19 based upon the currently available in vitro activity and human plasma pharmacokinetic data. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a “sandwich” complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral activity is through drug repurposing.

2020-03-26,First Clinical Study Using HCV Protease Inhibitor Danoprevir to Treat Naive and Experienced COVID-19 Patients,"Abstract  As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo®) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study ( NCT04291729 ) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naïve and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naïve and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Our findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.

2020-03-20,Deep learning-based computational drug discovery to inhibit the RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase: application to SARS-CoV and COVID-19,"<p xmlns=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/JATS1"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"">There is an urgency to find drugs and vaccines for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therapeutic options include repurposing existing drugs or finding new ones. One approach is to target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and block viral RNA synthesis. Currently clinical trials to repurpose remdesivir, a RdRp targeting pro-drug for Ebola, to COVID-19 is under way. More such potential drugs need to be identified to efficiently find best therapeutic options. To address this need, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model from literature was trained to read the SMILES fingerprint of a molecule and predict the IC50 of the molecule when binding to an RdRp. This model was trained using IC50 binding data from the PDB database. 310,000 drug-like compounds from the ZINC database were then screened using the trained LSTM model. Additionally, the 310,000 molecules with their predicted IC50s were used to train a generative Semi-Supervised Variational AutoEncoder (SSVAE) model from literature. Although not trained by actual experimental data (sufficient data are not available), the SSVAE model was used to generate 10 new molecules by sampling from the latent space to demonstrate its utility. These 10 molecules and the 1025 molecules with the lowest predicted IC50s from the LSTM model were docked onto the SARS coronavirus (a virus similar to COVID-19) RdRp using AutoDock Vina. Top four most stable inhibitors from the screened ZINC database compounds had binding energies of less than -33.89 kJ/mol. These binding energies were less than the binding energies of the comparison group consisting of prior drugs remdesivir, favipiravir, and galidesivir. Among the ten new molecules generated by the SSVAE model, the most stable new molecule had binding energy lower than the comparison group of prior drugs. The low binding energies of these molecules indicate they could potentially be good drug candidates for the SARS CoV and COVID-19. These results also show the utility of deep learning-based models in screening existing compound and generating new molecules to find drugs for COVID-19.</p>",2020-03-18,10.31219/osf.io/6kpbg,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125748258,"

2020-03-15,"Novel and potent inhibitors targeting DHODH, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, are broad-spectrum antiviral against RNA viruses including newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.",2020-03-12,10.1101/2020.03.11.983056,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125620261,"

2020-03-10,In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in 2019 and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late phase in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the drug's safety profile.
RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached 3 times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission.

Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic a-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the a-ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera.

",alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication," the main protease of coronaviruses and the 3c protease of enteroviruses share a similar active - site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the p1 position of the substrate. because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing ,  these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. in order to obtain near - equipotent ,  broad - spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses ,  betacoronaviruses ,  and enteroviruses ,  we pursued structure - based design of peptidomimetic a - ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3c proteases. six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus - infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell - toxic. optimization of the p2 substituent of the a - ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near - equipotency against the three virus genera. the best near - equipotent inhibitors ,  11u ( p2 = cyclopentylmethyl )  and 11r ( p2 = cyclohexylmethyl )  ,  display low - micromolar ec50 values against enteroviruses ,  alphacoronaviruses ,  and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. in huh7 cells ,  11r exhibits three - digit picomolar activity against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
